            <p>
                Hi there, I'm <b>Maxim Zabilo</b> and am a programmer!
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am a San Jose local as I have grown up here for most of my life. Undoubtedly,
                one of my favorite places is the Municipal Rose Garden. For my education I went to the
                <u>University of Minnesota Twin Cities</u> and graduated with a <u>Bacehlor's in Computer Science</u> this year!
                As such, I am looking for a job (ex: entry level) that would give me experience in the field. Ultimately, I would
                like to work on things related to Augmented and Virtual Reality. I am willing to learn
                as I was when making this site. Look at you in shock... Given how great my website layout
                CLEARLY IS you never would've even guessed that this page wasn't made using Wix or Squarespace ;)
            </p>

            <p>    
                One field in particular that I like is computer graphics. 
                A game I would like to thank for that is Minecraft. 
                When I was younger, I was hesitant to play it because of its "poor graphics" especially since
                I was playing games like Labyrinth 3D, Angry Birds, and Cut The Rope on my tablet which looked
                so much better to my eye. I ended up playing Minecraft anyway only to find myself enjoying exploring the 
                blocky surroundings and mining diamonds despite my previous opinions. Perhaps, I still wasn't completely fond
                of the visual aspects of Minecraft because I found myself  about different mods one of them being Optifine.
                Optifine enhances the graphics by making the Minecraft world look more realistic and that mostly has to
                do with how light is perceived by our eyes. The enhancement is not on the same level as raytracing, but it
                made me 
                Raytracing is fantastical, while the idea for it may have originated centuries ago today we are finally able to
                see it in work in realtime as our hardware has caught up to our ambitions. Saying Minecraft looks like a different
                game with raytracing would be an understatement, it's a whole other world!   

                When I was younger I used mods like Optifine to enhance the graphicswhich would Raytracing in Minecraft makes me feel
                like I'm playing a completely different game. The dynamic lighting that Unreal Engine 5 has is 
                crazy impressive.
            </p>

            <p> 
                In my spare time I enjoy longboarding, preferably on newly paved cement as the feeling of pushing
                off once and traveling so far is just sublime. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I know the answer to which came first the chicken or the egg so don't hesitate to ask!
